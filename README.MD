# ðŸ“¦ NodeWave Back End Candidate Assessment

Welcome! This is a project submission for the NodeWave Back End Candidate Assessment. The goal of this task is to build a backend API that supports Excel file uploads, background data processing, JWT authentication, and provides filterable and paginated endpoints.

## âœ¨ Features

    âœ… Excel file upload
    âœ… JWT-based authentication
    âœ… Excel parsing and storing data into the database
    âœ… Background processing simulation
    âœ… List uploaded files with filtering and pagination

## ðŸ“„ Project Flow

    1. User uploads an Excel file (template_product.xlsx).
        - The file can contain product data (e.g., product ID, name, price, quantity, category).
        - Users can upload an Excel file using the designated upload endpoint.
        - File Template: The Excel file uploaded should follow the structure of the template_product.xlsx, which can be used to format the product data correctly.
    2. The server responds immediately with a success message and stores the upload record as pending.
    3. The system processes the file asynchronously in the background.
    4. Users can retrieve a list of uploaded files filtered by status and paginated.
